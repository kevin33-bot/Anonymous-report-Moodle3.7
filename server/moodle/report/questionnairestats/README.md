# Questionnaire Statistics
In our institution (Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil - in portuguese, [Universidade Federal de Lavras - UFLA](http://www.ufla.br/portal/), we have an expressive amount of courses in progress (~ 1.7k in just one Moodle instance, called "Campus Virtual"). The sector that coordinates the activities related to the "Campus Virtual" administration is called "[Diretoria de Educação à Distância (DIRED)](http://www.dired.ufla.br/portal/)". In the final of undergrad classes period, DIRED performs an evaluation of the disciplines, professors, infrastructure among others educational aspects.

However, there is no a simple way to find out whether this evaluation mechanism (in gerenal, a questionnaire) is being effectively used or not, i.e., how many students are really ansering this questionnary? Is it a representative number? What are the courses with more (or less) responses for the evaluation questionnary?

We believe that the reponses about these questions are important because these may improve our strategies to promote the participation of the students in this type of evaluation. However, gathering the statistics of courses usage is not a trivial task, mainly when this is performed in a manual way.

Hence, we developed "Questionnaire Statistics"; this is a Moodle report plugin that helps the admin to known how the evaluation mechanisms (this version uses the "[Questionnaire activity module](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_questionnaire)") are being used by students. Feel free to use and contribute to this project by improving the plugin functionality or letting us to know about possible bugs existing in its code. 

**Important**: this plugin requires the "[Questionnaire activity module](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_questionnaire)".
